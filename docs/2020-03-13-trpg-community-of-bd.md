#### TRPG Community Bangladesh

Q:What is the TRPG Community Bangladesh? Who started it?

The TRPG Community is a platform for us to spread the love of the hobby of Tabletop role-playing games. The gameplay and the game itself was introduced in Bangladesh by Al-Zawad Islam Shadman but the core founders who had been with him from the very beginning were Takib Al Hasan, Shahriar Hakim Dipto, Ovishek Roy, Ahnaf Tahmid Khan, Naimul Hassan Nabil, Ishrak Ali Khan.

Q:Why did you start the TRPG Community?

There did not exist any Tabletop gaming community in our country. That is why we mainly started the community. But what inspired us the most was the sheer love we had for this hobby.

Q:How many members do you have?

Currently we have 109 registered members and 30 registered players who are all under the two only GMs (Game Masters) of the country.

Q:Tell us about your events and the struggles that came along?

At our first event many people played the game and witnessed how it worked. As soon as the Producer of Radio Dhol, Zahidul Haque Apu bhai, told us about coming to a show called Limited Edition hosted by Kaisar bhai on pop culture we jumped at the opportunity and did a radio show on RadioDhol's Limited Edition. Well, the struggles started to come in once we started getting members from outside of Dhaka. Currently, we have representatives in Sylhet and Chittagong. All of the core founders being 10th-grade students were more or less responsible for organizing and managing everything. Also a lot of times we had to put up with the negative feedback and since the real game sessions are done physically meeting and coming together, so we had to go through a lot of toils to ensure security for our members. We organized a TRPG booth at two different events. The first one was: Daraz PopShop 7 and the second one was Dhaka Comicon Express.

Q:What kind of feedback did you get from the Bangladeshi Pop culture Community?

We got a lot of positive feedback from the Bangladeshi pop culture community and many notable people from the pop culture community like Saadi Rahman bhai, Kazi bhai, Zahidul Haque Apu Bhai. Also a lot of support and advice from the International Tabletop gaming communities like D&D Beyond, FrogGod games etc. Also notable people like Kienata, Nerdarchist Dave and Nerdarchist Ted.

Q:What are your future plans?

Our future plan includes organizing a Tabletop Gaming Convention and also attending other upcoming pop culture events.

Q:Why should anyone play TRPGs?

The huge improvement in a personâ€™s social and communication skills is enough to attract any person to this hobby. But apart from this Tabletop gaming enhances creativity and imaginations along with mathematics and speaking skills.

Q:How is TRPG played?

A Tabletop game consists of at least one player and one game master (or GM) up to as many players as you want. Most of the time, a dice is used to determine the of your actions. The story is narrated by the Game Master (GM) and the players decide what they want to do at any point of the story.

We hope to see people of all ages together playing Tabletop RPG's in Bangladesh. For this reason, we hope to see more and more gamers, fans, etc pouring into our community and also volunteers who want to join us in our journey to help spread this. For details:
