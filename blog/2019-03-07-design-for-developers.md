## Outside some memeable quotes and the uniquely purple prose of the original visual novel's erotica,

 the  Fate  series is perhaps best known for its potpourri of characters picked from the entire length of human history and storytelling. One school of thought posits that all new stories we tell are just remixes of stories we've heard before, and in that regard, I've come to find  Fate  interesting in the nakedness of its belief in this tradition. That's not to say  Fate  is lazy and unoriginal in its approach to storytelling; quite the opposite, actually! It's *turned into a playground for writers to imagine how characters from different eras, cultures, and literary traditions might interact. Alliances form, passions are shared, and warriors from all schools of combat beat the crap out of each other.*

Fate/Grand Order  takes this approach to its logical extreme, remixing not only historical characters but also characters from  Fate's  own mythos into one big gacha-friendly frenzy. Its seventh main arc,  Babylonia, is naturally no exception. While I think the anime adaptation has done a good job of contextualizing most of its main players' motivations, I believe it's also illuminating to take some time to consider their origins in the oral and written tradition. Stories ebb and flow with the passing of ages, but some of these characters have persisted through multiple millennia. They didn't start out as sexy anime versions of themselves, and their presence in the collective consciousness of humanity certainly won't end here, so let's see where they came from.
