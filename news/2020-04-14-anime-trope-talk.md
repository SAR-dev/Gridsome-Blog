Often at times we cross anime with tropes that are very basic in way of representation, these anime are mostly known as Saddest of their genres and known more because of the Subtle Romantic Comedy moments, to turn into a Tragic Slice of Life Story...Which stops your breath in brief and then lets you to catch up all in at once again but basically keeps a place in ourselves motivated....

> But question is, _“Why”_?

**Let's try to understand what those story try to tell us first?**  
I know most of us have kind of this thing that we don’t like overly dramatic/overly slow-paced or even overly exaggerating Romance plots... But then again we often face the fact that all stories aren’t made equally and neither made with the amount of same components... Some stories flourish due to its characters and Open discussed storytelling where as some flourish due to its way of Set up... Usually these type of the ones are on the second type of Storytelling... Where mainly it’s focused on the set up of a plot that doesn’t interfere with the multiple choices but also keeps its healthy distance from everything... So, basically even if it's something you would describe as clichéd and predictable and meaningless...Still there is nothing to do cause it’s made to be like that and other than that it's your own wish to follow up or not cause we do share that amount of freedom.

Now that we understand what are the main difference and the bothering of how many of us hate the same cliched ending to be over and over again...We must also understand how the obvious plots can grasp us like that...i mean what is so mesmerizing or what is so Astonishing in such series?? That we cannot but feel sympathetic and feel as if someone of our own we lost...

**To firstly point out, The story designing...**
The directors or the animators or the creators are very clever in such series, they often use the benefit of Camera angling to point out certain points or messages that we see keep repeating in front of us yet we intentionally miss those out cause those things give us a sense of nervousness, a sense of fear and the ending which gets spoiled even in the beginning with certain way of styling the art and design even with the often mischievous animation scenes in Openings or Endings for an anime. Says everything more than you should know...Still you keep on wanting to know more...cause it’s a basic mind game Your going Through.... The more you know the more you want to know ( Not for all though, it’s mainly for animation executions, likewise how we often know how a scene goes in a manga still we get curious to watch the same thing to watch again in anime)... Here we also see the calculated move that writers take to let you get a place of suspense build up to your hearts which is the true beauty of Cinematography which often is used to show emotions in a series of fiction...Here just Dramatic build up makes an explosion of raw emotions at that moment...which basically is how you get grabbed into the deepest parts of a Slice of life anime and completely forget what else is happening aside. Because that is how things work. Here a part of Psychological game related to your neuron or hormonal cause effects since most of the audience are watching young teens in their teenage or just catching up to become a proper adult soon...Such instances is where our mind functions like an ever changing motion of film reel...And we keep watching everything flashing in front of our eyes which is brilliantly portrayed in such series...Despite plot holes which is again un-noticed due to such measures you face those times...

Now let’s talk about the Attraction that comes within the plot and story....

**★1.** The Animation and the glace of a mesmerizing atmosphere for the story to set while no chance of regret stays intact and ways how you can keep a full control of the scenes one after another plays a fine role here...Often the lack of experience and the lack of craftsmen causes many to fail in envision what it is meant for since the Visions of a Creator is the key purpose to watch the story which often gets distracted and 2 dimensionalised into the characters perspectives.... Which is one thing but we then again sure love characters flourishing Independently as storytelling and Story progressions also contribute in it....
making something Slice of life as it sticks to audiences little world but with share amount of worthiness...

**★2.** Contrasting deep thoughts, Contradicting to popular thoughts of how plots holes ruin a show, i will say today as a Devil’s Advocate that, it moreover leaves open blank spots for the creator to place the curious thoughts from the readers and the watchers to talk and head canon stuff...which basically leaves a roam for all to decode and nothing is permanent or fixed in an absolute way...
The old strategic of open storytelling is thus preferred in many story telling methods over the years.... Yes, i do acknowledge that such stories can have a lot of other factors which make it really wasted opportunity of a series but then again the amount of preference is what could be made into considerations...

**★3.** The Musical Appeal of heart...Just think about it...How many of us have been fevers through the flow of emotions as the songs and the musical notes begin to play in the backgrounds or even the occasional feelings of seasons as the Instrumental seizes the moment... Which we call in the voice of Literature as an appeal to Art...The fragments and the essence of long lasting feel of "Falling in love for the First time" or even "Being in Love for Forever" or "The Farewell of the feelings" and etc can be moved throughout playing of the osts...and thus many aspects of the shows enthrils and grasps all of us within its world building and plot... Even if we feel bored and questioned with the stories setting... We cannot but admit to the fact it is because of the Musical enthusiastic nature that keeps us watching a show till the end in many cases for majority...

-Now, the most important question plays in...
Which is,,, So, why do we get attached to it so much so we almost loose ourselves into a story no matter how bad or good it is?

For trope talks therefore, here due to only specific one trope as we are following...Examples giving by "Your lie In April", " Let me eat your Pancreas", "Anohana", "Plastic Memories", " Violet Evergarden" and many more similar shows in places...As we visit...we see a common order. Still such predictable yet such compressed series of incidents do catch us by the hook and for Great Shows into the Sad types, like Clannad, Angel Beats & Plastic Memories we often mention for their genuine plot and settings into the visit of all around in the voice of "The Narrator" till first to last...

But when it comes to Shows like, "Your lie in April" where many questionable set up due to characterization and mistakes put upfront by the author...Still the moments like Arima Kousei Crying thinking about his mother and playing music while seeing him behind the gallery full of audience...The Mesmerized musical key notes or even the musical Key strokes on Manga as it glossed over the panels and Draws out everything.... I was charmed to hault...the feeling you get to observe something is seriously nicely nod here...no matter how much i debunk It being a bad show... I can never take things like those from it...cz liking, disliking or saying something is good or bad is very Subjective and can't be said obsolete at All..

Then again how Story flows and how many say Music can’t be read in manga, well i had been Through those and not for music but the raw emotions flows everywhere which is basically the main goal and it is the thing that makes a Watcher kneel down in knees and admit something from their heart and not Mind...
Thus that is the moment we make up our minds and follow such tropes whole heartedly and everyone has their own story which are unheard and it makes people relatable to them...Again "Slice of life" magic happening as a Psychological phenomenon behind the scenes...

-To conclude, so does that mean we shouldn’t watch anime like those or should or must watch those types of anime??

> Well my Answer is, "It Is Up to You"

"Whether we Feel something is good or not, we always should try everything first and then comment on it" and about Calling something masterpiece for cheap attraction...#Well_We_Dont_Do_That_Here... Cause Every anime can’t be Masterclass but Every anime needs your Support and love (Maybe not All). Since animes are for our Entertainment and lets us take the positivity more than anything...
