**★Plotline:** The short world of animated scripts is how Kikumana is perceived, A short noted girl named "Kikumana" acting through stage performance, as it is believed but portrayed on a mannerism of visual representing, a stressful tyranny and a wonderful work of Arts in faster sequence, as imagination floods from hers to outer reality or all just created virtuality, that counts nothing but as a surprise to so many.

**★My Thoughts:** Generally speaking it is hard to catch something so hard to notice, yet once you get dived into it, you feel as if it is a charm but something amazing, getting ahead of bizarreness and the camera angling motions of making it look like a 3D blend old camera footage, while notable things I got from it was:

i) Firstly the world of Kikumana is a source of Dementia, yes the tag is there for a reason, and often at times we might ask just wondering what dementia is? 
In all honestly, Dementia  is a root syndrome here that is observed more or so like a human psychology, the thing which starts from a regular imbalance cognitive series of deficiency that later turns into the very significant term for Alzheimer's disease, a mental situation more or less, to say in a point. No, Dementia isn’t a disease, but it is something we all have witness, the detachment from reality, to a point we find ourselves out of place or out of memory, as a daily routine strikes us as we spend many times on a single task, imagination creates its own life form over our heads.

 It's something that we don’t realize but we do anyways from our sub-conscious minds. Frankly, how in sceneries in the ONA we see her, as she is bound with a place with books, symbolizing knowledge and imagination, as the more knowledge we gain, the more we learn, the more we believe, the more we go towards seeking help from ourselves and the more we find ourselves alone, cause everything is fabricated in this small reality of ours. “Kikumana” pictures that reality and gives the touch of dementia another sight, as she turns 360 degree all over to end up on the small closed room of hers to read and explore, amongst millions out there like her.

ii) Secondly, the proprietary term in the basic needs of psychological is a metaphorical approach to modern civilizations, as we further try to explore the world more laying back of wandering we get, it is not a simple perspective that contradicts but instead a simple eye to eye talk that narratives want us to feel, whether you get creeped out or you get weirded out, those light movements and Cuboids being in the place are all symbolism, sometimes works like simulations, casting to a threat of life every box full of prisoner marches. Seemingly how woken you feel or how pondering it may seem, you definitely see things that invest you in, may that be a mind game but it is all part of the purposes.


**★To Summarize:** Lastly, the whole systematic way of drawn back and forth animation is what psychological experiments can deceive, you may find it ludicrous and tiresome, or might see it gorgeously beautiful or even ask yourself what you just saw. To simply tell you, there is no straight answer, either the message that the creators wanted here remains pale or it’s just a storytelling about human psychological phenomenon and going creative overboard that back on a time period when things in animation fields were getting more interesting than ever as Millenniums hit by and came in 2001.
A picturesque presentation may seem delusional and strange but those tags alone is what makes me interested to explore maybe it is all just nothing but wasting time like how Kikumana wastes her day to day in a prison like state under darkness and Sprinkle of lights, gazing in for her to just read through the pages of the books from the collection out there..
