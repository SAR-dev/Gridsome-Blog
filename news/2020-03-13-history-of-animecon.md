“Hey, we should all come together to create the first Convention for anime in Bangladesh!” Oly suggested, enthusiastic.

“That would be so cool. I’m totally up for it!” I replied with similar enthusiasm.

AnimeCon Dhaka began in 2014 with humble beginnings, when a group of anime enthusiasts decided that the conventions for Bangladesh should be broadened to cater to anime and manga fans. That was when Oly Shahriar Hassan, Asif Muznabeen and I created the event.

We had always been an ambitious bunch and wanted to host the first major event. We started with humble beginnings with a simple meet that featured an art-contest and fan-fic writing competition in “Shalimar Garden” in Banani with 50 people attending. The event was a success and we were encouraged to pursue higher events.

Oly, Asif and I started working toward a proper AnimeCon early 2015, taking inspiration from various conventions throughout the world – Anime Boston, Comiket, Otakon and the like. And after a whole year of planning, and putting together the best team possible, we finally began in 2016, and the first AnimeCon came to life early July in Al-Fuad Community Center in Mirpur.

The event was hosted on a Friday, from 2 pm and the attendees reached a total of 1000 participants, and thus the first convention dedicated to anime, not only in Bangladesh, but the entire subcontinent flew off. Staying true to the style of conventions, the event had cosplay, with a cosplay competition that rewarded the best cosplay, a Japanese style fishing booth, various pop-culture merchandise stalls and even a stall with Japanese styled food, bands performed songs, and groups performed dances.

AnimeCon Dhaka was held again the following year in 2017, and this time at Mirpur Convention Center, with a larger audience of 2000+ attendees, and nodding at our previous convention, this time we also hosted a similar but larger cosplay competition that gave us some beautifully crafted cosplay, showcasing the talents of our youth. Once again, we kept Japanese food, a goldfish booth, with bands catering to anime soundtracks, and dance routines, but this time we added an art gallery to show the beautiful artworks of the community, a gaming booth that hosted a gaming competition. Our second event was a hit!

2019 marks the third time AnimeCon Dhaka will be hosted, bigger and better than the events previously hosted, and with June right around the corner, we are excited to see just how much better we can make the event!
